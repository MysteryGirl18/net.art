        <h1>Conclusion: </h1>
        <p>
            While the internet is certainly more complex in design and content now, there's this 
            human touch to older web pages and layouts that give the sense that people haven't changed 
            much over time. People posting online about their hobbies, lives, and favorite celebrities 
            hasn’t changed, and the Geocities webpages allow us to witness this. Today social media 
            allows us to exchange pictures and messages with more convenience than ever. But even as 
            technology changes rapidly over time and fuels this perception of change, in many ways people don’t.
