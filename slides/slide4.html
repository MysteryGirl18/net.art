            “Archive Team, a volunteer brigade of archivists, managed to rescue nearly a terabyte of GeoCities 
            pages prior to the shutdown, sharing this data as a torrent. Lialina and Espenschied began working 
            with the GeoCities archive as part of their reconsideration of the cultural value of 'Digital 
            Folklore.'”

    <p> The name "One Terabyte of Kilobyte Age" is what grabbed our attention to this project. It comes 
        from the fact that Archive Team preserved about a terabyte of GeoCities’s data, and this data 
        consisted of webpages that were stored on the level of kilobytes. For reference, 1 kilobyte stores 
        about a few paragraphs of text, a small image, or a short snippet of audio. One can see how the 
        amount of storage and sheer data on the internet has grown exponentially. For example, Google Drive 
        offers 15 GB (or 1,048,576 KB) of free storage! The project captures something special about a time 
        when websites were much smaller and simpler, and yet they still captured + progates elements of pop 
        culture and human connection.
